# Episodic-Memory-Benchmark-Evaulation-and-Model-Synthesis

Employs the Episodic Memory Benchmark framework and the Minerva dataset (specifically key categories of questions used from Minerva) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of different language models in simulating episodic memory. Implements a scoring mechanism to assess model performance on a range of episodic memory tasks. Based on this rigorous evaluation, selects the best model as the most promising candidate and subsequently refines its performance to achieve optimal results within the benchmark.
